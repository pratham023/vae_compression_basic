# vae_compression_basic
This project uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress the weights of feedforward, convolution, recurrent neural networks and long short term memory into a latent space, thereby reducing the memory required to store weights. For more information read https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14513
